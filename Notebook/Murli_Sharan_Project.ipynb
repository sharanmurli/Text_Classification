      "Review 1 (Label: 1):\n",
      "films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before . \n",
      "for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . \n",
      "to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . \n",
      "the book ( or \" graphic novel , \" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . \n",
      "in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source . \n",
      "if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes . \n",
      "getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? \n",
      "the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end . \n",
      "it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called \" unfortunates \" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . \n",
      "when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case . \n",
      "abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . \n",
      "upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach . \n",
      "i don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . \n",
      "in the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . \n",
      "it's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts . \n",
      "and from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( \" who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? \" ) . \n",
      "don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it . \n",
      "now onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) . \n",
      "the print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic . \n",
      "oscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place . \n",
      "even the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent . \n",
      "ians holm ( joe gould's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham . \n",
      "i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn't half bad . \n",
      "the film , however , is all good . \n",

      "Review 2 (Label: 1):\n",
      "every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody's surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling . \n",
      "mtv films' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example . \n",
      "did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ? \n",
      "the plot is deceptively simple . \n",
      "george washington carver high school is having student elections . \n",
      "tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high . \n",
      "mr . \" m \" ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run . \n",
      "and paul's nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons . \n",
      "the dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be . \n",
      "you can't help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have . \n",
      "_election , a good film , does not live up to its hype . \n",
      "what makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier . \n",
      "the similarities are staggering : \n",
      "tracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . \n",
      "max fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . \n",
      "the most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . \n",

      "tracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive . \n",
      "max fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive . \n",
      "the male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . \n",
      "he even gets a bee sting . \n",
      "the male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . \n",
      "he gets several bee stings . \n",
      "and so on . \n",
      "what happened ? \n",
      "how is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn't been fully formed yet ? \n",
      "even so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul's anti-social sister , tammy . \n",
      "broderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he's had since then . \n",
      "witherspoon is a revelation . \n",
      "it's early in the year , it's a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination . \n",
      "and once campbell's character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you're won over . \n",
      "one thing that's been bothering me since i've seen it . \n",
      "there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film . \n",
      "i suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . . \n",
      "but the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom . \n",
      "as the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story . \n",
      "it is bad enough that mr . m doesn't like tracy's determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ? \n",
      "even so , there's no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does . \n",
      "there's a lot to like in _election_ , but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven , mark this as a disappointment . \n",

      "the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn't the make the film all that more entertaining . \n",
      "i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is \" into it \" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding . \n",
      "i mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! ! \n",
      "okay , we get it . . . there \n",
      "are people chasing her and we don't know who they are . \n",
      "do we really need to see it over and over again ? \n",
      "how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ? \n",
      "apparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows . \n",
      "there might've been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess \" the suits \" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense . \n",
      "the actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood . \n",
      "but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character's unraveling . \n",
      "overall , the film doesn't stick because it doesn't entertain , it's confusing , it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it . \n",
      "oh , and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . . it's \n",
      "just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids . \n",
      "it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since . \n",

      "damn that y2k bug . \n",
      "it's got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother ( william this time ) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on . \n",
      "little do they know the power within . . . \n",
      "going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there , virus still feels very empty , like a movie going for all flash and no substance . \n",
      "we don't know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere , we don't know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ) , and , of course , we don't know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout . \n",
      "here , it's just \" hey , let's chase these people around with some robots \" . \n",
      "the acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis . \n",
      "you're more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 . \n",
      "sutherland is wasted and baldwin , well , he's acting like a baldwin , of course . \n",
      "the real star here are stan winston's robot design , some schnazzy cgi , and the occasional good gore shot , like picking into someone's brain . \n",
      "so , if robots and body parts really turn you on , here's your movie . \n",
      "otherwise , it's pretty much a sunken ship of a movie . \n",

    "<h3>Q1 (c) i. One can use tokenized text as inputs to a deep neural network. However, a recent breakthrough in NLP suggests that more sophisticated representations of text yield better results. These sophisticated representations are called word embeddings. “Word embedding is a term used for representation of words for text analysis, typically in the form of a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word such that the words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning.”. Most deep learning modules (including Keras) provide a convenient way to convert positive integer representations of words into a word embedding by an “Embedding layer.” The layer accepts arguments that define the mapping of words into embeddings, including the maximum number of expected words also called the vocabulary size (e.g. the largest integer value). The layer also allows you to specify the dimension for each word vector, called the “output dimension.” We would like to use a word embedding layer for this project. Assume that we are interested in the top 5,000 words. This means that in each integer sequence that represents each document, we set to zero those integers that represent words that are not among the top 5,000 words in the document. If you feel more adventurous, use all the words that appear in this corpus. Choose the length of the embedding vector for each word to be 32. Hence, each document is represented as a 32×L matrix</h3>"
