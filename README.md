## Text Classification using Python and Keras

---

## Project Description

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for text classification using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. The primary objective is to classify sequences of text data into predefined categories. The project leverages various machine learning techniques and libraries to preprocess data, build, train, and evaluate the model.

## Key Features

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The project includes data cleaning and preprocessing steps to prepare text data for model training. This involves tokenization, padding sequences, and splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Model Building**: An LSTM-based neural network model is constructed to capture the sequential nature of text data. The architecture includes embedding layers, LSTM layers, and dense layers for classification.

3. **Training and Evaluation**: The model is trained using the training dataset, and its performance is evaluated on validation and test datasets. Metrics such as accuracy and loss are used to assess the model's effectiveness.

4. **Visualization**: The project provides visualizations of the training process, including plots of training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs.

5. **Requirements**: A requirements.txt file is generated to list all the dependencies and libraries required to run the project.
